A plan to setup numerical simulations investigating parametric decay instabilities in linear devices.

Re-code 2D bispectral code such that input wavenumber and frequency correspond to the parent wave. This will ensure the validity behind the bicoherence/bispectral value returned.
Ths plan is the update the data loading structure as well as code performance.

Find the correct parameters for the linear device.
The magnetic field is known (?) from MagPy.
Plasma number density? RF intensity? RF frequency? Plasma material?

Hold a meeting discussing under what cirumstances non-monotonic density profiles (or perhaps, different origins to the density perturbations) arise in a linear device - do they exhibit ELMs,
magnetic islands etc?

Present SMILEI for the group - argue for its inclusion in the group:
- Easier for setup for Nifflheim
- Python input
- Teaching course 8-10 nov
